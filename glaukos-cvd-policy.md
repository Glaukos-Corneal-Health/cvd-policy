# Glaukos' Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

Glaukos has a commitment to receiving, coordinating and remediating security vulnerabilities in a responsible manner, in accordance with ISO/IEC 29417.

## Glaukos' Commitments

Glaukos commits to the following:

- **Act in good faith**: Glaukos will treat reporters respectfully and without threat of legal action, provided they follow this policy.
- **Prioritize user safety**: Glaukos will work quickly to assess and mitigate confirmed vulnerabilities.
- **Ensure transparency**: Glaukos will maintain clear, honest, and timely communication with the reporter during the disclosure process.
- **Enable coordination**: Glaukos will encourage responsible disclosure timelines to minimize risk before public exposure.

## Users and Researcher Responsibilities

Users and Security researchers are instructed to email reports to: [ProductSecurity@glaukos.com](mailto:ProductSecurity@glaukos.com) and include the following information:

- Product, service, or system affected,
- Vulnerability details and potential impact,
- Steps to reproduce,
- Tools/scripts used,
- Contact information

Glaukos instructs users to not exploit vulnerabilities beyond what’s needed to demonstrate impact, access, modify, or delete data, violate privacy or availability of systems, share vulnerability details with third parties before coordination.

Glaukos additionally instructs reporters to follow applicable laws and policies, allow reasonable response and resolution time, and coordinate publication timing (target 90 days for remediation).

## Actions Taken on Report Submission

Glaukos will acknowledge reports within 5 business days, will perform a triage and assessment within 10 business days. Afterwards, Glaukos will share a remediation plan within 30 days, or as soon as the risk is understood.

Glaukos will provide a fix or workaround and public acknowledgement (unless anonymity requested).
